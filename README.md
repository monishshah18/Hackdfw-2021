# Aqua: Water Distribution and Trading

Unfair water Distribution is not a new concept; it has affected civilization for millennia. We want to make sure Everyone who needs water gets it and that it is distributed fairly at our System.

In terms of water delivery to different basin areas, the current water market solely considers surface water. With our optimal distribution algorithm, we attempt to solve the distribution problem by adding groundwater alongside surface water, ensuring that all basins receive an equal quantity of water.
Consumers can buy or sell water based on their requirements and demands. Seasonally, the water will be moved between basins to maintain an equal distribution.
